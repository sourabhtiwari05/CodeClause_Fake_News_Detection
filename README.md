# Fake News Detection

In the era of information overload, it's crucial to separate factual and authentic news from fake news. This project is focused on detecting fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. 

Fake news can cause significant societal harm, leading to misinformation and confusion about critical issues. This project aims to mitigate this by providing an algorithm that can accurately classify a piece of news as "Real" or "Fake."

## Methodology

The primary language used for this project is Python, taking advantage of its powerful libraries for data analysis and manipulation, as well as machine learning.

The project uses various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the news data. This includes tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words. The processed text data is then converted into a numerical format (a process known as text vectorization), which can be used as input to the machine learning models.

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the processed data, including (but not limited to) Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. The performance of these models is compared to select the best one for the task of fake news detection.

## Results

The best-performing model is selected and used to create a final fake news detection system. This system takes a piece of news as input and outputs a classification of "Real" or "Fake."

## Future Work

There are endless possibilities to extend this project. Future work could include using more complex NLP techniques or deep learning models, integrating the model into a web application, or expanding the project to handle news in different languages.
